Plowbot is a minimalist jabber bot for plowshare. Once launched, it just
waits for links and downloads them using plowshare.

== Dependencies ==

python-jabberbot, pyxdg (and plowshare, obviously).

== Configuration ==

The first time you launch it, it will ask for credentials to be configured
with. Make sure the account you created for your bot has accepted an
account to be controlled from in his "friends".
