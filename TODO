Stuff to improve:

Download queue management:
check download links before queuing them: this way one should get a way to
manage the download queue and we would improve error messages.

Add a captcha queue:
Upload captchas somewhere and send mail/links to the user.

Commands to add:
list - list the downloads in the download queue
kill <id> - cancel/kill a queued/running download
captcha <id> <captcha_text> - fill a given captcha
